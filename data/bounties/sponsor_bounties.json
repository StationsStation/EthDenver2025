Any project is eligible as long as these requirements are met and they are not better suited to another Zircuit bounty category. This bounty will select the top three Telegram apps that connect to Zircuit. The top projects will be determined by functionality (fewest bugs or perceived problems with the solution), the uniqueness of the problem to be solved or the approach to solving it, and overall completeness.\u2705 What does a successful project look like?This bounty is all about combining social reach with cutting-edge blockchain tech to bring users a fresh and fun experience. Your challenge is to build a fully functional dapp or game that leverages Telegram\u2019s API and deploy it on Zircuit. Whether it\u2019s a game, utility tool, or community hub, your project should show off Zircuit\u2019s technical strengths while offering something new for Telegram users.A successful submission will include a functional prototype that solves the problem it\u2019s intended to address. It will showcase some innovation and creativity, either through technological or UI improvements. It may be complete and solve a long-standing open problem or introduce something with a lot of potential for future development. Either way, it has an impact on the Zircuit ecosystem.\ud83c\udfa8 UI/UX Design RequirementsThere are no external UI/UX design requirements, though the best projects will be accompanied by a clean interface (or necessary documents). Users should be able to interact with the dapp on Telegram, and on Zircuit-deployed code via MetaMask connected to the network if necessary. The dApp (or its documentation) should be responsive and easy to navigate; better yet; the Telegram app be self-contained so that users don\u2019t need to seek out external sites to interact with it.\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\u2696\ufe0f How are we judging it?This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, and creativity.Completeness and execution mean that the project is functional. These are the most important categories. Winning submissions should be as close to functional as possible and engineered properly. Ideally there are good test cases, designs for complicated use cases, and other supporting documentation. The sophistication of the code and whether it implements the project requirements may be considered. However, a brilliant but incomplete dApp is less impressive than one that works completely. Creativity will be assessed primarily to break ties. Winning projects should motivate their decision to build this solution, indicating which new problem they are solving, how they are solving a problem differently, or what new technology they are bringing to Zircuit.Other factors might include whether or not the system will scale, if there appear to be easier solutions, and the presentation of the solution itself. We\u2019ll need to understand what you built and submitted.\ud83c\udf0e Impact on the organizationThese bounties aim to help test the Zircuit network and build the Zircuit ecosystem. Through this act, we can ensure that the network performs as expected, correct any issues, and plan for any missing but desirable features. Through these project submissions, the diversity of the blockchain ecosystem grows and allows for more collaborations, integrations, and use cases.\ud83d\udcda ResourcesTelegram dapp boiler plate, provided by Zircuit: https://github.com/zircuit-labs/web3-telegram-mini-app Deploy on Zircuit Quick Start https://docs.zircuit.com/build-on-zircuit/deploy-on-zircuit Zircuit RPC Endpoints https://docs.zircuit.com/dev-tools/rpc-endpoints Verifying Contracts on Zircuit https://docs.zircuit.com/dev-tools/verifying-contracts List of Sepolia Faucets https://docs.zircuit.com/dev-tools/faucet Zircuit Discord: https://discord.com/invite/zircuit\ud83d\udc40 Some example use casesAny interesting Telegram applications are welcome: games, ZK apps, DeFi, AI, bridges, and more.

Making it modular will allow other kinds of stats to be added easily.The easiest way to start this project is to use the taraxa-indexer project as a backend and add the functionality for saving and serving the stats.The taraxa-indexer already connects to a node and syncs all DAG blocks, PBFT blocks and transactions.

This can be in any application area, we are interested in seeing what people can build when the tools are available for low cost ZK Proof verification using proof developed recently by leaders in the ZK SpaceA leading project includes these types of elements:Uses zkVerify for proof verification, and uses the results of the verification in the applicationZK Proofs are an essential aspect of the application.Using a new technology ZK Proof Verifier available on zkVerify:RiscZero ZKVM version versionNoir HyperplonkGroth16 using bn128 or bls-12-381Polygon FflonkDesigned to be extended into a production grade application with the assumption that low proof verification costs make it financially viableMobile device or Web browser application with good UXUses more than one type of proof in the application as part of the core functionalityWeb3 applications must integrate with one of our current partner blockchains, including:ArbitrumApechainEDU ChainEthereumFun, useful, something where people can see an immediate use case for this application\u2705 What does a successful project look like?We are seeking innovative projects that showcase the advantages of zkVerify's zero-knowledge proof verification chain. Benefits include significantly lower costs compared to EVM contract-based verification, support for advanced ZK proof systems, and faster verification through features like optimisticVerify, which provides instant responses on proof validity.Our zkVerify EVM contract allows seamless integration, enabling developers to confirm that proofs were verified off-chain, with our bridge periodically posting verified proofs on-chain to provide irrefutable evidence of verification.Examples of verifications include verifying private identity credentials, enabling provably fair gaming mechanisms, authenticating off-chain data such as IoT device outputs or financial records, ensuring tamper-proof randomness generation,securing cross-chain interactions, and validating ZK rollup proofs. Projects should demonstrate how zkVerify can power secure, efficient, and scalable solutions in real-world applications.One example of success could look like a web application game. ZK Proofs can be brought into the system in 3 different areas, all these include a user connecting their wallet Game play. The game includes hidden information that can only be accessed using a ZK proof. When the users clears a level or completes the game, their gameplay and score is verified with a ZK proof.When the game is over the score is posted to a leaderboard. The leaderboard is built from information that was verified to be correct by ZK ProofsThere is a wagering system on the leadboard information. This wagering uses a ZK proof to demonstrate the gaming was done by the rules, and funds were collected and paid by the rulesAnother example of success could be in the AI space:An organization builds an AI model on their proprietary information, which is not sharedSomeone pays to get answers from the AI modelThe user that pays for the AI model use gets a ZK Proof verification that the model was used, that they got what they paid for.This is on a web interface with connected wallet, demonstration of how the ZK Proof is used, and posting of the ZK proof verification result\ud83c\udfa8 UI/UX Design RequirementsThe application must have a functional user interface.

        "$4,000: Unlocking the Power of Permanent Domains: Build with ArNS (Arweave Name System)": "The Arweave Name System (ArNS) provides friendly, censorship-resistant, permanent domains for dApps, websites, identities, and data. ArNS domains go beyond simple addresses - they can be integrated into applications in multiple ways:Hosting & Routing - Use an ArNS domain as a permanent address for dApps, static sites, or content on the permaweb. Gateways automatically resolve ArNS names, making them easy to access from anywhere.Identity & Profiles - Assign an ArNS name as a user\u2019s identity in apps, linking it to their wallet, profile, or stored data.Smart Domains - Names can be programmed to trigger integrations, features, and automations, enabling dynamic onchain interactions.Composable & Permissionless - Developers can integrate ArNS purchases, domain linking, and management directly into their apps, leveraging a trustless, open protocol to provide seamless user experiences.ArNS isn\u2019t confined to the Arweave ecosystem. It supports cross-chain identities, meaning users can link Ethereum, Solana, or other blockchain-based addresses to their ArNS names. For example, a single ArNS name could reference both Arweave-stored data and an  Ethereum-based wallet address, creating a unified identity across multiple blockchains.
