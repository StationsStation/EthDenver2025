🏆 Winner Breakdown
Each winner is guaranteed a minimum prize of $1,000 USD. The total maximum prize amount of all projects awarded shall not exceed $2,500 USD.

If there is only one project awarded (winner), then each winner (only one) is guaranteed a minimum prize value of $1,000 USD, whereby that 1st prize is guaranteed a minimum prize of $1,000 USD and a maximum prize of $2,500 USD. This is the current prize pool and it will not change for this bounty.

If in the unlikely event the prize pool changes, and there are two winners, the existing total maximum prize amount will not change, but it will be split, where each winner is guaranteed a minimum prize value of $1,000 USD, whereby one prize (e.g. 1st prize) is guaranteed a minimum prize of $1,000 USD and a maximum prize of $1,250 USD, and the other prize (e.g. 2nd prize) is guaranteed a minimum prize of $1,000 USD and a maximum prize of $1,250 USD.

There can only ever be a maximum of two winners in the prize pool, otherwise it would not be fair, as a 3rd winning project would not be guaranteed a minimum prize value of $1,000 USD, since that would cause the total prize pool to exceed the total maximum amount of $2,500 USD.

If the judges find that no project is good enough to win, they'll be sure to explain why.

Story team reserves the right to reward less than the total number of awards or the award amount allocated for this track if submissions quality don't meet the criteria.

📝 Requirements
Submissions must integrate with the Story smart contracts or SDK. At a bare minimum read on-chain state. Top prizes will prioritize submissions that extensively interact with Story through on-chain state writes and reads.
Although all agents that integrate will qualify, judging will be based on how thoughtful the integration/plugin is of the ATCP/IP Whitepaper. For example, an agent that is registered as IP, licenses data from other agents, and licenses its own training data/outputs will be prioritized more than an agent that simply registers its image generation output.
✅ What does a successful project look like?
Ideally a submission has clear understanding of the ATCP/IP Whitepaper and showcases agent ↔ agent transactions, along with registration & licensing of training data and agent outputs.

This bounty is specifically related to AI Agents. For example (but not limited to): licensing training data from other agents, an agent licensing its own training data, licensing agent outputs (ex. image generation), licensing its personality, exchanging IP and paying royalty to other agents.
You could also extend existing frameworks by creating a Story plugin for the GoatSDK, Zerepy, Virtuals, or extending the existing elizaOS plugin, etc.
🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
There are no explicit UI/UX design requirements.

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
How focused the project is around Story (higher = better)

How thoughtful it is of the ATCP/IP Whitepaper
Adoption possibilities it unlocks
Technical implementation and degree of completion (i.e. functioning MVP)
🌎 Impact on the organization
AI is the most important technology of our lifetimes, and Story will be the home for open Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Alongside the ATCP/IP Whitepaper, your project will prove the importance of having an open standard for agent ↔ agent transactions.

We will be working closely with all participating hackathon teams beyond the BUIDLathon itself. This is an opportunity to build one of the first real integrations / infrastructure / tooling / products on the decentralized IP layer of the internet and work closely with the core protocol team in helping us shape the future.
Story is more than a global IP repository, it is laying the foundation for agent ↔ agent transactions, a necessary step towards achieving AGI.
There is a very high chance for follow up funding/grants if the project is high quality and the team members are keen to continue the journey to mainnet.

Story team reserves the right to reward less than the total number of awards or the award amount allocated for this track if submissions quality don't meet the criteria.

📝 Requirements
Submissions must integrate with the Story smart contracts or SDK. At a bare minimum read on-chain state. Top prizes will prioritize submissions that extensively interact with Story through on-chain state writes and reads.

Although all projects that integrate will qualify, judging will be based on how thoughtful the integration is and how centric Intellectual Property and native Story functionality is to the project. For example, a DApp fully focused on IP will have a higher chance of winning compared to a DApp that randomly calls a function just to qualify for the bounty. Be creative!
We prefer usage that covers more functions in the protocol, from registration of IP to licensing. Ideally it would use 2 or more modules (Licensing, Royalty, or Dispute - all found in our documentation).
Projects that are related to AI Agents or IPFi will not quality for this track. Those projects should submit under one of the other two tracks.
✅ What does a successful project look like?
Ideally a submission has a clear use-case for Story and is thoughtfully integrated such that it makes sense from both a technical and use-case perspective.

This bounty is not theme specific and therefore eligible for all ideas (except AI Agents and IPFi). For example (but not limited to): automatic royalty tracking and distribution for licensed IP, music licensing, photo library with built-in IP registration, LLM attribution and provenance, IP onboarding tools, IP marketplaces, short video remixing, collaborative platforms like GitHub for IP franchises, Webtoon/Wattpad with new monetization mechanism for creators, all the way to application contracts that interact with the protocol itself. We encourage novel ideas and usage of the protocol.
Keep in mind Story is introducing a completely new layer to both web3 and web2: the layer of intellectual property, attribution and licensing – the opportunities are endless!
🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
There are no explicit UI/UX design requirements, but judges will appreciate smooth UX flows that are focused around providing a magical user (and/or developer) experience.

### $8,000: Best Project on Zircuit

The best projects that deploy on Zircuit will receive special recognition. MVP here doesn’t stand only for Minimum Viable Product, but also for Most Valuable Player. These apps can be anything, like DeFi, AI, social, gaming, infra, etc… but only the best ones will win this prize. The project should be well built, tested, and have a compelling use case.

🏆 Winner Breakdown
The top two teams:
First place: $6000
Second place: $2000

📝 Requirements
The project needs to be deployed on Zircuit Mainnet or Testnet. In order to qualify for the first place, it needs to be fully operational and offer a good interface for the users. The smart contracts must be deployed on Zircuit and verified via the Zircuit Explorer.

A GitHub repository containing the project artifacts (smart contracts, tests, documentation) and a solid README of the project must be submitted.
The README should include:

a clear short one-sentence description of your submission
a short description of what you integrated Zircuit with and how
short description of the team and their backgrounds
clear instructions for testing the integration
feedback describing your experience with building on Zircuit
optionally, a short video demo or slide deck. 
Any project is eligible as long as these requirements are met. This bounty will select the top two projects deployed on Zircuit.

✅ What does a successful project look like?
These gems are the projects that will both attract web3 users, and inspire future hackathon projects because of their outstanding quality. Creative, complete, and secure projects are those that fit into this category. Any use case and features are welcome: those that are very technical may impress the judges if done correctly but simpler ideas may be easier to do well. The projects can include custom smart contracts, or can in a central way use and integrate other projects that are already deployed on Zircuit.

A successful submission will include a functional product, or a prototype, that solves the problem it’s intended to address. It will showcase some innovation and creativity, either through technological or UI improvements. It may be complete and solve a long-standing open problem, introduce something with a lot of potential for future development, or it can just attract users (human or AI) and offer an outstanding web3 experience. The primary objective for success is to have a positive impact for the Zircuit users and ecosystem.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
There are no external UI/UX design requirements, though the best projects will be accompanied by a clean user interface. The interface is a requirement for the first prize award. The interface should be simple and clear. It can be web-based, integrated through a messaging application, or via the command line. Users should be able to interact with Zircuit deployed code via wallets connected to the network. The dApp (or its documentation) should be responsive and easy to navigate. The requirement to include a UI doesn’t apply for the second prize.  

Winning projects should have a user-centered design that makes it easy for the target audience. This can be end users or developers integrating the project into their own codebase. The best-of-the-best may also include consistent visually pleasing designs.

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, creativity, and ability to attract and engage users.

Completeness and execution mean that the project is functional. These are the most important categories. Winning submissions should be as close to functional as possible and engineered properly. Ideally there are good test cases, designs for complicated use cases, and other supporting documentation. The sophistication of the code and whether it implements the project requirements may be considered. However, a brilliant but incomplete dApp is less impressive than one that works completely. 

Creativity will be assessed primarily to break ties. Winning projects should motivate their decision to build this solution, indicating which new problem they are solving, how they are solving a problem differently, or what new technology they are bringing to Zircuit.

Other factors might include whether or not the system will scale, if there appear to be easier solutions, and the presentation of the solution itself. We’ll need to understand what you built and submitted.

🌎 Impact on the organization
These bounties aim to help attract users and new applications to the Zircuit network. Interested participants may receive ongoing support and partnerships with Zircuit that will enable them to operate, and become even further embedded into the Zircuit ecosystem.

✅ What does a successful project look like?
**Zircuit + DeFi + Ai = The Dream Team. **Success looks like eerily life-like on-chain agents, sky-high yields collected by an AI model, or infra to empower the future of AI on-chain. We’re not looking for anything specific, but the combination of AI and DeFi is critical. The AI can reside off-chain, but some part of the app should use or empower an AI model in a meaningful capacity.

A successful submission will include a functional prototype that solves the problem it’s intended to address.

### $2,000 for the best project

📝 Requirements
We built CDP to make it possible to build amazing crypto applications that aren’t solely for financial applications but anything in need of onchain rails. Your tasks is to:

(1) Use CDP SDK and OnchainKit in a meaningful way in an innovative consumer crypto application, (2) Think Big, working backwards from a vision that would bring a billion users onchain.

✅ What does a successful project look like?
Success is an application with an easy onboarding experience, simplified/abstracted crypto interactions, and a delightful set of features for users. It can be oriented toward crypto natives, but we encourage taking a stab at seeing what’s possible if you build with crypto behind the scenes and use it to power unique experiences.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
The easier you can make it for someone to interact with, the better. For this, we recommend integrating with other CDP tools, like Smart Wallet (https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/smart-wallet) and Onramp (https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/products/onramp).

👀 Some example use cases
Currently, agents run mostly offchain and interact with blockchains only to perform transactions. We would like to see more agent functionality move onchain! 
Leverage the ICP platform to build decentralized alternatives to the plugins that already exist for agent platforms such as ElizaOS and LangChain:

Access secure onchain randomness for trading strategies or games.
Massive cheap decentralised storage for agents
Manage signing keys securely using threshold cryptography chain key signatures
Sign transactions on 20+ chains, mint and send tokens
define access control rules for your multi chain smart contract wallet deployed on the ICP
agent can only transfer X amount of ETH per day
agent can only trade X amount of USDC on Uniswap deployed on Arbitrum
agent can only interact with certain pools
ICP can act as a verification layer that enables trusted, auditable, and verifiable AI agents. Create modules or tools that track all of the actions of an AI agent curated on any popular AI agent framework such as Eliza or ZerePy.
Another option is to run the whole agent onchain, on ICP. In that case, the ICP platform itself acts as the agent framework. We define an “agent” as a process that runs and performs actions independently on behalf of users or groups of users. Examples:
An agent that monitors market conditions and executes trades that meet certain criteria, see forum discussion: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/decentralised-traiding-competitions/36814
An auto-managed index fund that periodically rebalances itself
An agent that interacts with offchain AI systems to process information about anything from trading strategies to NFT content.

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
Does the project follow best smart contract practice? Does the project take advantage of the DAO for these practices?

Does it use a upgradable contract with proxy pattern? If it is upgradable, use DAO proposal to upgrade the contract as you make additional progress during the hackathon.

Does it have mutable settings? Use DAO proposal to modify the settings.

Does it have a kill switch? If it has a kill switch, does it use a special subDAO (with Multi-sig) so it can be turned off in minimum time?

🌎 Impact on the organization
We want to see how projects use the DAO with creative ways to manage the protocol. We want to get feedback or requests from the projects.

👀 Some example use cases
A DeFi protocol may have many settings to control liquidity requirements or rewards calculations. For example, you may rewards points for different actions happening on your protocol, which will be the base for airdrops in the future. Community (DAO members) should be the one deciding how many points each action gets - deposit, swap, withdraw. To make it interesting, make the point value negative if user withdraw!

A social protocol may have time-off period for offensive behaviors. Would that be one hour, one day, or one week? Make it a setting in the protocol that the DAO can vote to change.

Any settings in the protocol can and should be changed by DAO and DAO only.

### $2,500: Taraxa L1 Network Stats Dashboard

Build a modern, realtime and responsive dashboard for the Taraxa L1 Network.
If completed successfully, this dashboard will allow the Taraxa community to monitor and get an overview of the network as a whole.
For this challenge you will need to create a modular frontend application (we prefer React) and a set of components that use a charts library to display the most important network statistics on the Taraxa L1 network plus a backend that stores these stats in a timeseries database and exposes them to the frontend application. Making it modular will allow other kinds of stats to be added easily.

The easiest way to start this project is to use the taraxa-indexer project as a backend and add the functionality for saving and serving the stats.
The taraxa-indexer already connects to a node and syncs all DAG blocks, PBFT blocks and transactions. It also has a small set of API endpoints that can be extended to serve the stats as well. The only requirement here is to know Golang.

Another option would be to create a new type of “indexer” in your preferred programming language.

Keep in mind that this needs to be fast as the Taraxa L1 network supports a lot of transactions per second. This means that you need to save the data in a database that is made for storing timeseries data. We also would prefer it if this could be descentralized (local database, each instance runs close to one RPC node)

Some statistics that would be interesting for us:

Current finalization time (time between blocks)
Total number of transactions
Daily transactions graph
TPS
Highest TPS
Total number of wallet addresses
Number of unique wallet addresses over time
Number of validators
Number of active / inactive validators
These stats can be separated into multiple categories like Overview, Network, Validators, etc.

📝 Requirements
To be eligible, your app must:

Be realtime by keeping up with the network speed of block production.
Look modern and, preferably, in the style of other Taraxa ecosystem apps.
Have enough stats that a user can get an overview of the network at a glance.
✅ What does a successful project look like?
A successful project is functional, looks good, and is useful for both the Taraxa team and community.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
We prefer the dashboard app to look like other Taraxa apps or like the Taraxa website but it definitely needs to be modern, slick and maybe have a few animations.

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?

### $2,500: Use Taraxa as if it were an Ethereum L2

Taraxa is 100% EVM compatible, but much faster & lower-cost than Ethereum. Build any dApp that uses Taraxa as if it were a L2 for Ethereum. For example, Taraxa could be used to offload high-frequency but low-value transactions away from Ethereum, with periodic settlements between the two networks.
FYI Taraxa currently bridged to ETH via the Ficus Root Bridge which you could use for this bounty, but you could also make use of anything else you'd like (even if it's centralized).

Core Goals:

Demonstrate with a dApp how Taraxa's L1 network could be used as a L2 for Ethereum, e.g., by offloading transactions from Ethereum to Taraxa with periodic settlements
The dApp could be anything, but it needs to actually solve a real world problem
Bonus: in addition to Ethereum, make Taraxa into a L2 for a non-EVM compatible network as well.

Create a project that utilizes the MutAgent or expands the MutAgent functionality. The MutAgent is an AI Agent protocol where you can mint agents and characters to chat with that have ever-evolving personalties that are stored on the blockchain.

What is required to complete this bounty?

MutAgents are unique, blockchain-backed AI characters with personalities that evolve based on user interactions. Every conversation, whether positive or hostile, shapes their traits and is recorded as an immutable record on the blockchain. To complete this bounty, participants must incorporate MutAgents into an engaging game or application that highlights this evolving personality concept, or significantly expand or improve the existing project. This can include making the MutAgents smarter, building a robust platform to host them, or introducing any other innovative features.

✅ What does a successful project look like?
Success is demonstrated through a working demo that shows either the MutAgents functioning in an interactive game or application, or a significant enhancement to the project such as improved functionality, smarter interactions, or an expanded platform for broader usage.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
Participants must provide a clean, intuitive user interface and user experience. There should be a publicly accessible web application or hosted demo allowing anyone to interact with the MutAgents and see how their personalities evolve.

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
Projects will be judged on their creativity, technical execution, user experience, and alignment with the MutAgents concept. Criteria include the degree of innovation, scalability, and overall quality of the final product or enhancements.

🌎 Impact on the organization
By supporting this bounty, the organization benefits from creative experiments with MutAgents, which can lead to new ways for dApp and game developers to integrate evolving AI characters into their projects. This fosters both community engagement and expanded possibilities for the broader ecosystem.

📝 Requirements
You must deliver a working proof-of-concept or product that leverages Queries in a meaningful, demonstrable way. The basic requirements include fetching at least one piece of data from a source chain and verifying it on another chain. If building a product and not a devtool, show how your smart contract uses the query response bytes to confirm correctness. Share an open source code repository with a README explaining the solution, setup and how to run a demo. Bonus for working demos of how an end user or developer can interact with your solution.

It doesn’t have to be a fancy frontend, CLI or minimal UI are even better as long as it’s easy to follow. This must be your team’s own work and should highlight a usecase that specifically benefits from on-demand, multichain state reads or builds tooling around this infrastructure. These are the bare minimum requirements to show you’ve built something that harnesses Queries effectively.

✅ What does a successful project look like?
Ultimately, success is about** innovation and practical utility **and you can approach this as either a dApp or developer tooling.
End-to-end use cases are listed out in the examples below and can include things like lending dApps that query collateral on other chains in realtime, light oracle aggregators, or single interfaces showing multichain NFT attributes or quests.

Developer tools or libraries could include a framework or CLI that automates building and verifying Query requests, making it simpler for other devs to integrate, or a frontend tool where devs can add in function signatures, chain IDs or block numbers to generate Query payloads and decode results, or middlewares such as a “Query Explorer”.

We will also judge on integration depth such as showing useful use cases of batched queries, using Solana queries to pull useful information from Solana to EVM. We would like to ensure you have a clear understanding of Guardian verification, incorporate possible fallback mechanisms, and provide a clean overall architecture. Show you’ve considered real usage! Basically the more you push the envelope the higher your chance of winning :) show your solution solves a real problem and can be extended by other devs.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
We’re not looking for pixel-perfect design, but clear and intuitive user flows. We’d love to see clarity of workflows, step-by-step examples or small example scripts that are easy to run. We’d love to see realtime feedback on frontends if you have one, or showing attestation signatures or Guardian data in a debug tab, so users can more easily visualise and understand the trust-minimised angle!

Any user guidance or clear READMEs are a plus, and the simpler overall, the better for a hackathon. Would definitely encourage open-ended creativity too, feel free to brand, style or narrate how you wish. The most important thing is function and clarity, you want judges to grasp how your solution works in under five minutes.

Video intro:


👀 Some example use cases
Potential project examples:

A lightweight, chain-averaged multichain oracle
A multichain marketplace, gathering listing and ownership details from a remote chain
A dashboard for rates on all arbitrage-target assets like LRTs/Stablecoins across chains or even per DEX
More details below:
Multichain NFT or Game Inventory

Instead of bridging an NFT, let dApps read the latest NFT attributes from Solana and Ethereum using queries.
Show a unified inventory in realtime, verified on demand.
Build new primitives in the NFT or GameFi space.
Multichain Collateral or Credit Score

Empowers more seamless lending experiences across chains.
A DeFi lending protocol on one chain can verify user collateral or credit score on another chain.
Light Oracle or Lightning Price Feeds

A custom oracle aggregator could use Queries to fetch DEX spot prices or aggregator quotes from various chains, and return a single final price feed to any chain wanting an attested “global average price.”
Potentially huge cost/time savings vs. spinning up a custom bridging solution or paying gas on each chain.
Multichain ID or Rep System

ZK badges anchored on Ethereum could use Queries on another chain to verify users meet specific criteria.
Could pair and be composable with other existing onchain ID solutions to bring them together and aggregate rep/DID systems.
Solana Stake Pool Aggregator

Allow projects to easily show the realtime exchange rates from Solana using sol_account queries.
If needed, the EVM can trustlessly verify the stakepool ratio or total staked lamports in a single step before performing an action, perfect for multichain staking dashboards.
Multichain KYC Composer

Query the user’s “isKYCed” status from Ethereum or other chains to return attested statements for destination chains to confirm this data on the spot.
Replaces the typical “update the whitelist on each chain” approach and lets you unify compliance logic in one place, but still enforce it on other chains.
Games

Multichain puzzles or treasure hunts are now possible
Show how to unify data or create educational material with chain-agnostic quests or games!

### $2,500: Anvil Protocol: New Collateralizable Contract Idea Spec

Anvil is a collateral management protocol for the issuance of fully secured credit. While users' collateral is secured in our Collateral Vault, the protocol contains "Collateralizable Contracts" that users can interact with in order to utilize their token balances for the purpose of issuing credit. Letters Of Credit allow users to utilize their collateral to issue credit to a single beneficiary (1:1) and Time Based Collateral Pools allow for multiple users to participate in staking pools (many :1). Anvil is looking for its next protocol concept that supports leveraging users' collateral in a meaningful way.

🏆 Winner Breakdown
We're awarding prize money of $2,500 to the team with the most efficient contract that meets our criteria. If no contract fully meets our criteria enough to win, we may choose to divide and allocate the prize money for any worthwhile contributions.

📝 Requirements
Smart contract file written in Solidity that is able to successfully utilize at least one non-Uniswap DEX to process
convertLOC()

via the
ILiquidatable.sol

interface callback in the
LetterOfCredit.sol

contract

Tests demonstrating that if the [mocked] oracle price is such that the collateral factor meets or exceeds the liquidation threshold, liquidation happens, if not it doesn’t.
✅ What does a successful project look like?
Efficiently processes eligible conversions of at risk dynamic LOCs
Liquidation incentive can be either kept by the implementation owner or sent back to the caller
Code is written in Solidity and well documented
🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
Must provide a repo link to the contract, test script with any instructions needed to run the testing framework.

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
Liquidator must use at least one decentralized exchange (DEX) that is not Uniswap to process the conversion

Testing against collateral factors must pass
Liquidator must be open source and available for implementation by anyone
🌎 Impact on the organization
In our decentralized protocol, dynamic LOCs are only useful if they are liquidated when they become at risk (as defined by collateral factors determined by Anvil's Governance). The Acronym Foundation (Anvil's creator) currently runs Liquidators (see
UniswapLiquidator.sol

in our public repo) in addition to the protocol's incentives for other parties to run their own liquidators to process these conversions. The more readily available a diversity of open source contracts are to implement, the more likely it is to have LOC conversions be processed in a truly decentralized manner.

📚 Resources
Anvil's Github Repo
Current Uniswap Liquidator example
Protocol Docs

👀 Some example use cases
Use other (non-Uniswap) DEXs with a readily available supply of protocol-supported tokens to perform the liquidation

Multiple DEX usage would involve evaluating the cheapest price across multiple DEXs to process the liquidation
💼 Recruitment Opportunities
The Acronym Foundation is looking to hire qualified developers, risk managers, and security researchers that are passionate about the Anvil protocol.

🏆 Winner Breakdown
We are not sure what our total bounty prize money is, but our breakdown will be roughly: 1st place 60%, 2nd place 30%, 3rd place 10%

Example Winner breakdown (if bounty $5,000):

### $2,500

### $1,500

### $1,000
📝 Requirements
A working AI Agent or AI Agent plugin that allows a user of the agent to interact with the Euler protocol solely via actions taken by the agent. Primarily we're looking for basic interactions such as supplying into a specified vault, but a project that goes above and beyond would allow the agent to have some ownership over optimizing deposits, borrows, and yield amounts. An example to something similar would be BrahmaFi + Morpho agent as mentioned in this tweet - https://x.com/brahmafi/status/1881387071774048390?s=46

✅ What does a successful project look like?
Success looks like an end to end case of a user starting with some amount of assets in their EOA, setting up and interacting with the agent, and ending up with the agent controlling a user's position in Euler on their behalf, which could be at least a deposit/loan position, but any additional work towards optimization would be great additional features.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
The primary user interface would be a text like interaction - perhaps through telegram or some other chat interface.

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
We'll be judging based on completeness or near-completeness of the specified interactions. If there are multiple projects that have complete integration completed, then the projects will be judge on the extent of additional features and ease of use.

🌎 Impact on the organization
The impact would be great to drastically simplify user interactions with Euler, which on its own is a fairly complex protocol.

Each qualifying project earns a $5000 bounty.

If we get less than five projects, or they're not meeting our criteria, the prize money might change. It could be between $1,000 and $9,000. If no project meets our criteria enough to win, we'll explain why.

📝 Requirements
Build a Web2 or Web3 Application that uses an advanced ZK Proof publicly verified on the zkVerify blockchain. 

This can be in any application area, we are interested in seeing what people can build when the tools are available for low cost ZK Proof verification using proof developed recently by leaders in the ZK Space

A leading project includes these types of elements:

Uses zkVerify for proof verification, and uses the results of the verification in the application
ZK Proofs are an essential aspect of the application.
Using a new technology ZK Proof Verifier available on zkVerify:
RiscZero ZKVM version version
Noir Hyperplonk
Groth16 using bn128 or bls-12-381
Polygon Fflonk
Designed to be extended into a production grade application with the assumption that low proof verification costs make it financially viable
Mobile device or Web browser application with good UX
Uses more than one type of proof in the application as part of the core functionality
Web3 applications must integrate with one of our current partner blockchains, including:
Arbitrum
Apechain
EDU Chain
Ethereum
Fun, useful, something where people can see an immediate use case for this application
✅ What does a successful project look like?
We are seeking innovative projects that showcase the advantages of zkVerify's zero-knowledge proof verification chain. 

Benefits include significantly lower costs compared to EVM contract-based verification, support for advanced ZK proof systems, and faster verification through features like optimisticVerify, which provides instant responses on proof validity.

Our zkVerify EVM contract allows seamless integration, enabling developers to confirm that proofs were verified off-chain, with our bridge periodically posting verified proofs on-chain to provide irrefutable evidence of verification.

Examples of verifications include verifying private identity credentials, enabling provably fair gaming mechanisms, authenticating off-chain data such as IoT device outputs or financial records, ensuring tamper-proof randomness generation,securing cross-chain interactions, and validating ZK rollup proofs. Projects should demonstrate how zkVerify can power secure, efficient, and scalable solutions in real-world applications.

One example of success could look like a web application game. ZK Proofs can be brought into the system in 3 different areas, all these include a user connecting their wallet 

Game play. The game includes hidden information that can only be accessed using a ZK proof. When the users clears a level or completes the game, their gameplay and score is verified with a ZK proof.
When the game is over the score is posted to a leaderboard. The leaderboard is built from information that was verified to be correct by ZK Proofs
There is a wagering system on the leadboard information. This wagering uses a ZK proof to demonstrate the gaming was done by the rules, and funds were collected and paid by the rules
Another example of success could be in the AI space:

An organization builds an AI model on their proprietary information, which is not shared
Someone pays to get answers from the AI model
The user that pays for the AI model use gets a ZK Proof verification that the model was used, that they got what they paid for.
This is on a web interface with connected wallet, demonstration of how the ZK Proof is used, and posting of the ZK proof verification result
🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
The application must have a functional user interface. Because this is an application designed to showcase capabilities, it should be either a browser or mobile app based interface.

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
The purpose of zkVerify participating in this hackathon is to demonstrate that there are many unmet needs in both the Web2 and Web3 Application space that can be solved using advanced technology ZK Proofs coupled with low cost proof verification on a public, decentralized, permissionless blockchain.

There is not any specific web2 or web3 application goal in mind, we want to see builders use their creativity and knowledge of different areas of life and business to come up with something creative and useful that showcases the system we have built.

All the criteria are directed toward meeting these goals.

🌎 Impact on the organization
A team that can build a demonstration application using zkVerify to showcase one of the application areas we have researched, or come up with something new, will have a significant positive impact on our organization and the success of our project.

The case we are making to the wider Ethereum space is that ZK Proofs are useful for much more than Ethereum scaling infrastructure, that there are many creative and useful ideas waiting on advanced ZK technology and low cost proof verification, and now is the time.

A great demonstration application will help our project have a more successful mainnet launch, a bigger value of our token when we have the Token Generation Event, promoted as a leader in the space by our big marketing team, lauded by our project leadership, and be a leader in our community and ecosystem!

### $4,000: Unlocking the Power of Permanent Domains: Build with ArNS (Arweave Name System)

The Arweave Name System (ArNS) provides friendly, censorship-resistant, permanent domains for dApps, websites, identities, and data. 

ArNS domains go beyond simple addresses - they can be integrated into applications in multiple ways:

Hosting & Routing - Use an ArNS domain as a permanent address for dApps, static sites, or content on the permaweb. Gateways automatically resolve ArNS names, making them easy to access from anywhere.
Identity & Profiles - Assign an ArNS name as a user’s identity in apps, linking it to their wallet, profile, or stored data.
Smart Domains - Names can be programmed to trigger integrations, features, and automations, enabling dynamic onchain interactions.
Composable & Permissionless - Developers can integrate ArNS purchases, domain linking, and management directly into their apps, leveraging a trustless, open protocol to provide seamless user experiences.
ArNS isn’t confined to the Arweave ecosystem. It supports cross-chain identities, meaning users can link Ethereum, Solana, or other blockchain-based addresses to their ArNS names. For example, a single ArNS name could reference both Arweave-stored data and an  Ethereum-based wallet address, creating a unified identity across multiple blockchains. This interoperability sets ArNS apart from systems like ENS (.eth names), which are limited to a single blockchain and domain structure.

🏆 Winner Breakdown
A bounty is split into three tracks. There will be one winner per track. A single team can compete on one or on all three tracks. A single team may win all three tracks. Or 3 teams may be winners in each track. 

1.	Signal Intelligence Challenge (Track 1 - Data)

Expand AlphaSwarm’s intelligence by integrating new data sources and market signals. Improve trading strategies by leveraging emerging narratives from Twitter, AIXBT insights, copy trading models, anti-rug detection, and cross-channel data aggregation. The goal is to give agents better foresight by tapping into high-value, real-time information. The winning submission gets $5,000.

2.	AIFi Alpha Architect (Track 2 - Reasoning & Strategy)

Take AlphaSwarm’s decision-making to the next level by enhancing its planning and execution logic. Improve alpha detection, risk assessment, and yield optimization to create a more adaptive and resilient agent.

The winning submission gets $5,000.

3.	On-Chain Action Innovator (Track 3 - Unique Use Cases)

Move beyond trading—design new agent-driven actions in DeFi. This could include automated liquidity provisioning, vault management, liquid restaking, or AVS monitoring. The challenge is to demonstrate how AI agents can autonomously manage complex financial interactions, unlocking novel DeFi opportunities. The winning submission gets $5,000.

If we get less than three projects, or they're not meeting our criteria, the prize money might change.

📝 Requirements
Participants must integrate the AlphaSwarm Starter Kit and demonstrate an AI agent that:
Track 1. Processes novel data sources (e.g., Twitter trends, AIXBT insights, copy trading, anti-rug detection).
Track 2. Enhances reasoning & strategy (e.g., alpha detection, risk management, yield optimization).
Track 3. Executes novel on-chain actions (e.g., liquidity provisioning, vault management, liquid restaking).

✅ What does a successful project look like?
An ambitious successful project that hits all 3 tracks might include an agent or a set of agents that automatically analyzes market data from Dexcreener and Cookie.fun, detects changes in liquidity levels, and autonomously adjusts a liquidity pool position across multiple DEXes. It could use Twitter sentiment analysis to predict market shifts, trigger actions on a Uniswap pool, and adjust positions based on risk tolerance set by the user.
